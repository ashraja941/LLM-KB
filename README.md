Create a knowledge base based on your chat with an LLM. 

Over the past few months, I have been using LLMs to learn more and more, asking it to create a study plan and then teach me through that. One thing that ticks me off a lot is going back to revise using that chat.
What I much prefer is having a obsidian like knowledgebase system, that I can quickly go through to revise a certain topic.
I want to create an application that is the best of both worlds. that is I still want to learn and ask questions using an LLM. but I also want that LLM to store the chat in a form that I can come back to later.
